# Steelbore Construct

A collection of **Claude / LLM agent skills** used across the Steelbore
ecosystem. Each top-level directory is a self-contained skill — a `SKILL.md`
that the agent loads on demand, plus optional `references/` files consulted
only when a deeper lookup is warranted.

These skills encode conventions, tool preferences, brand rules, and compliance
requirements so agents produce Steelbore-consistent output without needing
the rules re-attached to every prompt.

<!-- §1 — Who this is for -->
## Audience

- **LLM agents** (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Copilot CLI, Codex, etc.) loading
  skills from `~/.claude/skills/`, `~/.gemini/skills/`, `~/.codex/skills/`.
- **Humans** reviewing, extending, or auditing Steelbore's conventions.

<!-- §2 — Skill catalogue: keep alphabetical, one line per skill -->

<!-- §3 — Layout convention -->
## Directory layout

Every skill follows the same shape:

```
<skill-name>/
├── SKILL.md           # Frontmatter + the agent-facing instructions
├── LICENSE.md         # GPL-3.0-or-later (per Steelbore Standard §4)
├── CREDITS.md         # Required when the skill builds on third-party work (Standard §13.3)
└── references/        # Optional; consulted only when depth is needed
    ├── <topic>.md
    └── ATTRIBUTION.md # Optional deeper credit file for adapted references
```

Skills are also distributed as `<skill-name>.skill` bundles (zipped) at the
repository root for drop-in installation.
