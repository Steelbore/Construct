# CREDITS

The `steelbore-cli-preference` skill recommends and documents modern CLI
tools authored by many upstream projects. While the reference prose is
original writing, flags and behaviours were cross-checked against the
sources below. Filed in accordance with
[The Steelbore Standard §13.3](../steelbore-standard/SKILL.md).

## Upstream sources

| Name | Author(s) | License | Source URL | Scope |
|------|-----------|---------|------------|-------|
| tldr-pages | tldr-pages contributors | CC BY 4.0 | https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr | Primary cross-check for tool flags and invocation patterns. No verbatim tldr text appears in this skill — all prose is rewritten in agent-structured form. |
| Each tool's official README and `--help` output | Respective tool authors | Various, per tool | Per-tool project page | Flags and behaviours not covered by tldr. |
| Manual pages (`man`, `info`) | Respective tool authors | Various, per tool | System manpath | Standards-track tools like `curl`, `ffmpeg`, `sudo`, `flatpak`, `nix`. |

See [`references/ATTRIBUTION.md`](references/ATTRIBUTION.md) for the
per-source breakdown, the per-tool tldr-availability list, and the
fair-use note covering tool names, flags, and behaviours.
