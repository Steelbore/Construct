## Project identity

<PROJECT_NAME> is <ONE-SENTENCE-WHAT-IT-IS>, organized as a
<WORKSPACE-SHAPE> targeting <PRIMARY-USE-CASE>. Part of Project
Steelbore.

## Build, test, lint

- Build: `<EXACT-BUILD-COMMAND>`
- Test: `<EXACT-TEST-COMMAND>`
- Lint: `<EXACT-LINT-COMMAND>`
- Format check: `<EXACT-FORMAT-CHECK-COMMAND>`
- SFRS audit: `<EXACT-AUDIT-COMMAND>` <!-- e.g., cargo run -p <name>-audit -- check . -->

## Architectural invariants

<!--
  Document things that the code's structure ASSUMES that aren't visible
  in any single file. The agent will violate these without prompting if
  not warned.
-->

- Every sub-command returns `Result<Response<T>, AppError>`; never bare
  `T` and never raw error types to stdout.
- All timestamps use `<CHOSEN-TIME-CRATE>`; alternatives are forbidden.
- The `OutputMode` is computed once at main entry and threaded through
  every sub-command — never recompute mid-command.
- <ADD-PROJECT-SPECIFIC-INVARIANTS>

## Forbidden patterns

<!--
  Things that LOOK reasonable but break THIS codebase. Be specific.
-->

- `println!` / `eprintln!` direct calls. Use the OutputMode-aware emit
  helpers exclusively.
- Local-time formatting anywhere. UTC only.
- `unwrap()` / `expect()` outside `#[cfg(test)]`. Use `?` with proper
  AppError conversion.
- <ADD-PROJECT-SPECIFIC-FORBIDDEN-PATTERNS>

## Environment expectations

- Rust toolchain: stable, MSRV <VERSION>.
- `cargo`, `rustc`, `clippy`, `rustfmt` installed via rustup.
- Do NOT assume nightly features.
- Do NOT install crates outside the workspace lockfile.
- <ADD-PROJECT-SPECIFIC-ENV>

## Where to look for ___

- Error types: `<PATH-TO-ERROR-MODULE>`
- Schema sub-command: `<PATH-TO-SCHEMA-CMD>`
- JSON envelope: `<PATH-TO-ENVELOPE>`
- Output mode detection: `<PATH-TO-OUTPUT-MODE>`
- Integration tests: `<PATH-TO-INTEGRATION-TESTS>`

## Standards compliance

This project follows the Steelbore SFRS v1.0.0. The
`steelbore-cli-standard` and `steelbore-agentic-cli` skills are
authoritative on structural and agentic conventions. This file
documents project-specific deviations and supplements only.
